    <p>Cat finds himself backstage in a great hall. A woman comes by and gently powders his face. He asks her for the meaning of all this and she smiles. "Don't you know?" she says, "You are being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize!". Cat goes onstage to a great applause. He stands by politicians from around the world as the standing ovation continues. By the award plaque, he can see cans of the finest cat food, waiting to be eaten.</P>
